# exTHmUI GSI

## Build
To get started with building exTHmUI GSI, you'll need to get familiar with [Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html) as well as [How to build a GSI](https://github.com/phhusson/treble_experimentations/wiki/How-to-build-a-GSI%3F).
- Create a new working directory for your exTHmUI build and navigate to it:
    ```
    mkdir exthm; cd exthm
    ```
- Clone this repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/kindle4jerry/treble_build_exthm -b Tenshi
    ```
- Finally, start the build script(the first time):
    ```
    bash treble_build_exthm/build.sh
    ```
- If you want to rebuild it, run
    ```
    bash treble_build_exthm/rebuild.sh
    ```
